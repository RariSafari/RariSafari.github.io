    <h1>Lead</h1>

    <p>
      Lead, which they called &ldquo;plumbum&rdquo;, was widely used
      in Roman times and has been around for thousands of years. They
      used lead to make pipes, writing tablets, and coins. They also
      used it to make pots and pans, which later caused lead
      poisoning.

    <p>
      It is a natural element, but it is rarely found as a pure
      element. Instead it is most commonly found in ores of lead
      sulfide (galena). It is isolated by being smelted which converts
      the ore to the compound of lead oxide. The lead oxide is then
      heated with pure carbon which isolates the lead. The formula
      looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      PbO<sub>2</sub> + C--heated&rarr;CO<sub>2</sub> + Pb
    </p>

    <p>
      Lead&rsquo;s boiling point is approximately 1750&deg;C, its
      melting point is 372.46&deg;C, its density is 11.34 grams per
      cm<sup>3</sup>, and its hardness is marked at 1.5 Mohs. It is
      solid at room temperature, it is gray colored, it has 82 protons
      and 4 valence electrons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lead use was decreased when the effects of lead poisoning were
      understood. For example, it was used in ammunition, sheet lead
      (used in building construction), solder, piping for water and
      sewage, ball bearings, radiation shielding, and as a gasoline
      additive. Though lead is hardly a frequently used element, it
      is still used in lead stoage batteries.

      No one is sure how lead got its English name, but its chemical
      symbol comes from its Roman name. Pure lead is priced at $2.45
      for 100 grams, $11 a pound. It can cause immediate and long-term
      health problems, especially with children.
